# TheStore

This project is aimed at anyone who enjoys reading and talking about what they have read, viewing & reviewing books, saving them in a library/wishlist/list for future use, meeting new and interesting people who have read the same book as them, finding new books and Authors, reading qoutes from books they are interested in. But overrall I would like this website to be a functioning buisness after the course. Selling Fitness/Health and well-being products, -products that aid people in their life experience and health, natural supplements and built off of affiliate marketing and products I have myself invested personally in. So the user stories below are the basics I'd like to cover as a MVP, and the extra features depending on the time I have left.
